Notes:
	I was unsure if the hw4 file was meant to also make the file but I
	set up the functionality so that all that is necessary is to run the
	hw4 bash script. It will both call the make command and then run the project
	as well. It does not interfere with how the project runs, but for further
	clarity I wanted to inform you as to what my thought process was.
